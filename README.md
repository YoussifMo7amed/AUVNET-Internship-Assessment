AUVNET Internship Assessment ❤️‍🔥

Welcome to the AUVNET Internship Assessment project! This repository contains a simplified Flutter-based e-commerce application developed to demonstrate my skills in Flutter development, Clean Architecture, and state management using the BLoC pattern and Cubit.

Project Overview
This e-commerce application features:

⦿ User Authentication: Sign up and login functionality.

⦿ Product Browsing: View and browse products.

⦿ Product Details: Detailed view of products.

⦿ Shopping Cart: Add products to the cart and proceed to checkout.

⦿ Order History: View and manage past orders.

⦿ Profile Management: Update user profile, change theme mode, view order history, and log out.

The app integrates with Platzi Fake Store API for backend simulation. State management is handled using the BLoC pattern with Equatable for complex state and Cubit with Freezed for simpler  state management tasks like theme mode changes. Local storage is managed with Hive for cart, checkout, and order history, although caching was not implemented due to time constraints.

Project Features

► Core Features

⦿ User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login functionality.

⦿ Product Browsing: Explore products with list and detailed views.

⦿Product Details: View detailed information for each product.

⦿ Shopping Cart: Add items to the cart, view cart details, and proceed to checkout with an order summary.

⦿ Profile Management: Manage user profile, change theme settings, view order history, and log out.

► Technical Specifications

⦿Architecture: Simplified Clean Architecture (Presentation and Data layers) for scalability and maintainability.

⦿ State Management:

• BLoC: Used for complex state management with Equatable for immutability.

• Cubit: Used with Freezed for simpler tasks like theme mode changes.

⦿ Backend Simulation: Integrated with Platzi Fake Store API for network operations.

⦿ Local Storage:
• Hive: Implemented for managing cart, checkout, and order history.
• Caching: Planned with Hive but not completed due to time constraints.

► Setup and Installation

⦿ Prerequisites

• Flutter 3.0.0 or later

Architecture Overview

► Clean Architecture

The project is structured according to Clean Architecture principles with a simplified approach:

»»» Presentation Layer: Contains UI components and state management logic.

»»» Data Layer: Manages network operations and local storage (without dedicated data sources due to time constraints).

► Code Quality

»»» The code follows Dart and Flutter best practices, focusing on clean, well-commented, and modular design for maintainability.

► Local Storage

»»» Hive is used for local storage, managing cart, checkout, and order history. While caching was planned, it was not implemented in time for this assessment.
